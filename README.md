# README

A Chargify Code Challenge response. To get this running, you need to add a .env file with a FAKEPAY_SECRET. Write if you need to ask me for mine. The API works for all exemplary and all six types of malformed requests, as long as you have a FAKEPAY_SECRET and work off the sample request below. At the moment, unlike the Fakepay.io endpoint, no authorization token is required to submit requests to _this_ API endpoint. But never fear ... JSON Web Tokens are coming soon to an API near you, along with a bundle of other features that this developer is anxious to learn and implement.

#### Invalid Purchase Amount (Plan Model Validation Prevents This Error)
##### Warning: All Plan Prices / Amounts Must Be "Hectared" Before Submission (i.e. "9900" = $99.00)
The nearest thing to an invalid purchase amount you can achieve is a plan not found response.
```
Response: 404 Plan Not Found
{
    "status": 404,
    "error": "Not Found",
    "exception": "#<ActiveRecord::RecordNotFound: Couldn't find Plan with 'id'=5>",
    ....
```

## Error-Driven Development Paradigm

This was written by grace of [Error-Driven Development](https://halogenandtoast.com/error-driven-development/) (EDDâ„¢), with manual rather than automated testing, and plenty of elbow grease. More tests will be added to RSpec next week.

Mea maxima culpa.
